## Deployment Options

MedInv can be deployed in three main configurations:

1. **Local Development Mode**: Uses a local MySQL database
2. **Vercel Deployment with PlanetScale**: Uses PlanetScale or other cloud MySQL providers
3. **Demo Mode**: Uses an in-memory database that resets on page refresh, requiring no database setup

The application automatically detects the environment and connects to the appropriate database based on environment variables.

## Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd MedInv
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up a local MySQL database**
   - Install MySQL locally
   - Create a new database named `test2` (or your preferred name)
   - Use the SQL schema in `db-schema.md` to create the required tables

4. **Configure environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Update the database credentials to match your local MySQL setup
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=test2
   DEPLOYMENT_MODE=local
   ```

5. **Run migrations and seed data**
   - Use the SQL commands in `db-schema.md` to populate initial test data

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Vercel Deployment (100% FREE)

1. **Create a GitHub repository**
   - Push your code to a GitHub repository

2. **Create a PlanetScale database** (FREE TIER)
   - Sign up for [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) - no credit card required
   - Create a new database selecting the "Hobby" (free) plan
   - Create a connection string in the PlanetScale dashboard
   - Import the schema from `db-schema.md` using the PlanetScale console or CLI

3. **Deploy to Vercel** (FREE TIER)
   - Sign up for [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - no credit card required
   - Create a new project and connect to your GitHub repository
   - Make sure the "Hobby" (free) plan is selected
   - Configure the following environment variables in Vercel's dashboard:
     ```
     DEPLOYMENT_MODE=planetscale
     DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@region.connect.psdb.cloud/database_name?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":true}
     ```

4. **Deploy the application**
   - Click "Deploy" in the Vercel dashboard
   - Wait for the build and deployment to complete

5. **Access your deployed application**
   - Use the URL provided by Vercel

## Database Configuration

The application is designed to work with local MySQL, cloud database providers like PlanetScale, or in a database-free demo mode. The database connection is managed through the `lib/mysql.ts` file, which determines the connection method based on environment variables.

### Switching Between Deployment Modes

1. To use a local MySQL database:
   - Set `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=local` in your .env file
   - Configure the DB_* variables for your local MySQL instance

2. To use PlanetScale or other cloud MySQL providers:
   - Set `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=planetscale` in your .env file
   - Set `DATABASE_URL` to your cloud MySQL connection string

3. To use the demo mode (no database required):
   - Set `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=demo` in your .env file
   - No database configuration needed
   - Perfect for quick demonstrations or testing
   - Data resets when the page refreshes

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| DEPLOYMENT_MODE | `local` for local DB, `planetscale` for cloud DB, `demo` for in-memory DB | `local` |
| DB_HOST | MySQL host for local deployment | `localhost` |
| DB_USER | MySQL username for local deployment | `root` |
| DB_PASSWORD | MySQL password for local deployment | `` |
| DB_NAME | MySQL database name for local deployment | `test2` |
| DB_PORT | MySQL port for local deployment | `3306` |
| DATABASE_URL | Full connection URL for PlanetScale/cloud DB | - |

## API Endpoints

The application includes RESTful API endpoints for all major resources:

- `/api/patients` - Patient management
- `/api/medicines` - Medicine management
- `/api/inventory` - Inventory tracking
- `/api/orders` - Order processing
- `/api/medical-logs` - Medical logs and history
- `/api/dashboard` - Dashboard statistics and metrics

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Node.js
- **Database**: MySQL (local) / PlanetScale (cloud)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Switching Between Deployment Modes

To switch the application between local and cloud database modes:

1. Update the `DEPLOYMENT_MODE` environment variable:
   - `local` for local MySQL database
   - `planetscale` for cloud MySQL database

2. When switching to `planetscale` mode, ensure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is correctly set.

3. When switching to `local` mode, ensure the `DB_*` environment variables are configured for your local MySQL instance.

The application reads these environment variables at runtime to determine how to connect to the database. This allows you to easily switch between development and production environments.
